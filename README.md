Objective of this project is to predict the end userâ€™s age, by taking into account the user behavior and environments, has been proposed. 

The core idea of this proposed methodology is to extract key features and develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the age.
To achieve this goal, traditional machine learning models and deep learning models to predict the individual user age and age buckets 
have been developed.
